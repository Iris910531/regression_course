# The Impact of Common Advanced Baseball Statistics on Weighted On-Base 


## Introduction

This is my final report for the regression analysis course I took in my sophomore year, focusing on analyzing hit quality data on on-base rates using SAS. This project aids baseball teams in better understanding how to train their players.

## Data Source

The data source is an international website for advanced statistical analysis of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States, savant (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/). The sample consists of advanced data for hitters in the MLB from 2015 to 2022, who have a certain number of plate appearances. This includes the hitters' weighted on-base percentage (wOBA), age, average exit velocity, average launch angle, sweet spot percentage, and barrel rate.

## Tools and statistical methods Used

- **SAS**: use SAS 9.4 (English).
- **statistical methods**:
1. regression Modeling and model selection with interactions including hypothesis testing
2. Diagnosis and/or remediation
3. Explaining relationships and estimating (predicting) response variables, including the interpretation of an interaction.
